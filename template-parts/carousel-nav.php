      <h3>Portfolio Home</h3>
      <p>Server and client side for a portfolio and project sharing application built with a React user interface.
        Apollo Client takes care of the request cycle from start to finish, and using graphQL queries and mutations,
        this project needs no flux to handle component state. Portfolio uses mlab to run a MongoDB instance, so the app
        can be deployed and live without a local server.</p>

      <h3>PacWest Canopy</h3>
      <p>PacWest is a WordPress theme built from Scratch with authenticated routing and ACF throughout. We went above
        and beyond to provide the client with a fully customizable site, including icons and images easily from the WordPress
        backend. Much custom PHP and many advanced plugins were employed to make this beautiful site. As with this site, I use 2 stage photo rendering to decrease loading times.</p>

      <h3>Hummingbird Network</h3>
      <p>Hummingbird Network was an engaging project that allowed me to flex my Sass/HTML/PHP muscles and build a great
        WP theme from scratch. We had some time consraints, but I am happy with the finished product. ACF and CF7 used
        throughout to enhance the end user experience.</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Hi-Jane&c=apps">
      <h3>Hi-Jane</h3>
      <p>A production React-Native project built using Firebase, and Google Cloud. We used React-Native-Navigation for the routes and NativeBase for many of the components. I enjoyed building reuseable components throughout, and using Redux to control component state. We integrated and served up Java/Swift components built to satisfy the other software products managed by GetintheLoop. It was great to work on a shared code base and further enhance my organization and code architecture skills.</p>
